				<h1>2. Driving Instructors</h1>
				<p>

					employed by the School. As such, the School is not a party to any
					contract that might exist between the Instructor and You (but see
					Clause 11.5 as to Our responsibility and liability for his/her acts or
					omissions); 2.2 The Instructor is registered with the DVSA as an
					approved driving instructor (ADI) and his/her ADI registration will be
					up to date. He/she shall display his/her current DVSA ADI registration
					certificate in any vehicle that he/she uses for a lesson, and will
					ensure that that ADI certificate is kept up to date at all times.
				</p>
				<h1>3. Driving Lessons</h1>
				<p>
					3.1 A lesson will only be made available to You if You have a
					pre-booked appointment for it. You should book a lesson with the
					Instructor in person or elsewhere, or by phone or email, or through
					Our website following an initial booking made through the School. It
					shall be Your and the Instructor’s responsibility to agree all matters
					relating to each lesson including, but not limited to, date, time,
					location and duration; 3.2 Your request to the Instructor to book a
					lesson will be an offer, but whether to accept any request will be for
					the Instructor to decide in his/her discretion. Only if and when
					he/she tells You that he/she accepts Your request for any particular
					lesson(s) will there be a binding contract between You and your
					instructor for that/those lesson(s); 3.3If You wish to make a booking
					for two or more lessons by means of a single booking and in his/her
					discretion the Instructor accepts that booking; 3.4 Neither We nor the
					Instructor will reserve any lesson slots or guarantee regularity of
					lessons over any period of time or on any particular date and/or time
					except that We and the Instructor will reserve a particular lesson
					slot for You if and when the Instructor accepts a booking for it from
					You. Nevertheless, We and the Instructor shall use reasonable
					endeavours to make available regular lesson slots for You; 3.5 If You
					know You are going to be late for a lesson, You should contact the
					Instructor to tell him/her. If You arrive (or are not ready) later
					than 15 minutes after the scheduled start time for Your booked lesson,
					the Instructor will try to provide that lesson but if the Instructor
					decides that he/she cannot do so, the lesson will be treated as
					cancelled without notice by You and, if the Instructor then decides to
					make a charge for that lesson cancelled without notice, sub-Clause 3.7
					below will apply; 3.6 You may cancel a lesson without charge if You
					give the Instructor at least 48 hours prior notice of the cancellation
					and if You do so We will refund to You (or will ensure that the
					Instructor does so) any sum You paid in advance; 3.7 If You do not
					give the Instructor at least 48 hours notice prior notice of
					cancellation of a lesson, The instructor will be entitled to charge
					You for any net financial loss that he/she suffer due to Your
					cancellation (including any sum for which We are liable to the
					Instructor for the lesson cancelled) but not more than 100% of the
					full price of the lesson. he/she will be entitled to deduct that
					charge from any sum You paid Us in advance, and We shall refund the
					balance to You; 3.8 If, due to exceptional circumstances, including,
					but not limited to, illness, accidents and bereavement, You cancel a
					lesson without giving the Instructor at least 48 hours prior notice,
					he/she will consider the circumstances and in his/her discretion
					decide whether to waive any charge for late cancellation that We are
					entitled to make under sub-Clauses 3.5 and 3.7; 3.9 If We or the
					Instructor wish to cancel a lesson, We or he/she may do so without
					incurring any liability to You (and You will not have to pay for that
					lesson) if We or he/she gives You at least 48 hours prior notice, but
					if he/she or We do not give You at least that minimum notice, We shall
					be liable for and shall credit You with an adtitional lesson at no
					charge; 3.10 Notwithstanding sub-Clause 3.9, We or the Instructor may,
					without incurring any liability to You, cancel a booked lesson at any
					time before the start time of that lesson, where either: 3.10.1 Due to
					the Instructor’s illness, unavailability of a suitable vehicle, or
					other reason beyond his/her or Our reasonable control, he/she is not
					available or We or he/she are not able to provide the lesson fully or
					properly. If the lesson is cancelled in such circumstances, We will
					refund (or will ensure that the Instructor does so) to You in full any
					advance payment that You have made for that lesson; 3.10.2 The
					Instructor has reason to believe that You are not fit to drive at the
					time of the lesson due to any factors including, but not limited to,
					alcohol, drugs (whether prescribed or otherwise), illness or other
					medical condition. If We or he/she cancels the lesson for such reason,
					We shall be entitled, at Our or the Instructor’s discretion, either to
					charge You for that lesson or not to do so, but in deciding whether to
					charge You, We and he/she shall act reasonably; 3.11 The Instructor
					shall use all reasonable endeavours to start a lesson at the time
					which You have booked but the start may be delayed by overrun of a
					previous lesson or by other circumstances. If a delay to the start is
					at least 15 minutes, or if at any time before or after You or the
					Instructor arrives for a lesson We or the Instructor notify You that
					there will be a delay of at least that time, You may cancel and will
					not have to pay for that lesson and We will refund (or will ensure
					that the Instructor does so) to You in full any advance payment that
					You have made for that lesson. If, however, in those circumstances You
					do not cancel the lesson, the Instructor shall adt on to the lesson
					the time by which the start is delayed at no charge to You or, if that
					does not suit You, he/she shall adt it on to a subsequent lesson, or
					if You do not book a further lesson, We will refund (or will ensure
					that the Instructor does so) a part of the fee for that lesson in
					proportion to the part of the lesson not adted on; 3.12 Where the
					contract We make with You is not made on Our premises, the Regulations
					give You the rights set out in this sub-Clause 3.12, and they will be
					in adtition to the rights given to You by the above provisions of this
					Clause 3. You may for any reason cancel any lesson(s) during the 14
					day period after the Instructor accepts the booking for it/them, but
					if the booking includes any lesson(s) on a date which is before the
					end of that period and if You have expressly requested the Instructor
					or Us to provide any such lesson(s) and We or he/she does so, You may
					not cancel that or those requested lesson(s) and You must pay for them
					in accordance with Clause 5, and You may then only cancel any other
					lesson(s) covered by that booking. If You request that any lesson be
					cancelled, You must confirm this in any way convenient to You. If You
					cancel any lesson(s) as allowed by this Sub-clause 3.12, and You have
					already made any payment(s) for the lesson(s), We will refund (or will
					ensure that the Instructor does so) the payment(s) to You within 14
					days of receiving Your cancellation less the amount due for the
					lesson(s) that You have received.
				</p>

				<h1>Lessons-location,length</h1>
				<p>
					4.1 The Instructor will agree the location for each lesson with You at
					the time of booking. He/she may choose a location which requires
					adtitional travel in the interests of road safety. In such cases, if
					You wish to be picked up and taken to that location by the Instructor,
					travel time will form part of the lesson time; 4.2The minimum length
					of a lesson will be 2 hours and, if You and the Instructor agree, it
					may be increased by increments of 30 minutes up to a maximum length of
					3 hours.
				</p>
				<h1>Fees and Payment</h1>
				<p>
					5.1 You must pay Our fees for all lessons, and We will charge for
					lessons on an hourly basis. You can obtain information on current
					lesson fees from our website, or from the Instructor. 5.2 We may
					change Our fees without prior notice but if We increase or reduce the
					fees between the time You book a lesson and the date of the lesson and
					You pay for it in advance of the lesson, the price increase or
					reduction will not apply to that lesson but where there is a decrease
					We may in Our discretion decide to refund You the amount of the
					decrease; 5.3 You shall make payment of Our fees in advance by debit
					card, credit card, cash, cheque or Bank Transfer [subject to
					sub-Clause 5.4]. The Instructor shall give You a receipt for all sums
					that he/she receives from You; 5.4 You may pay Our fees direct to the
					Instructor (by debit card, credit card, cash, cheque or bank transfer)
					but if You do so You should obtain a receipt from the Instructor and
					it will be for the Instructor to account to Us for the payment. 5.5
					Payments in advance for driving lessons they must be applied to the
					driving lessons by You within six months of the date. Fees are
					non-refundable, and courses must be completed within 6 months of
					booking.

					The Instructor shall, at all times: 6.1 use his/her reasonable
					endeavours to provide driving instruction at the agreed lesson times;

					but shall not be responsible for any errors made by You; 6.3 be
					professional and courteous towards You and other road users; 6.4 act

					or the Instructor may immediately cancel one or more lessons. If the
					Instructor does so, he/she may in his/ discretion still charge for the
					cancelled lessons.
				</p>
				<h1>8. Vehicles and Insurance</h1>
				<p>

					Instructor are fitted with dual controls, are fully roadworthy, taxed,
					have a valid MOT (where relevant), and are fully insured for the
					purposes of driving instruction; 8.2 You may request to use Your own
					vehicle. Whether You use Your own vehicle is for the Instructor to

				<h1>9. Driving Tests</h1>
				<p>
					9.1 The Instructor shall discuss driving tests with You and shall

					You shall be responsible for booking theory and practical tests. It

					all details of Your test including, but not limited to, the date and

					attend a test, You must take all required documentation with You. If
					You do not, Your test may be cancelled and You would then lose Your
					test fees; 9.6 Unless the Instructor feels that Our or his/her vehicle

					9.9 applies, We generally permit Pupils to use Our or the Instructor’s
					vehicle for their test, but whether the Instructor permits You to do
					so for Your test will be in his/her discretion; 9.7 If the Instructor
					has given You permission to use Our or his/her vehicle for Your test
					but it breaks down or is otherwise unavailable or unusable on the date
					of the test, the Instructor shall use reasonable endeavours to arrange
					an alternative vehicle. If this is not possible, We shall not pay for
					the replacement test; 9.8 If Your test is cancelled by the DVSA giving
					You insufficient time to provide the Instructor with the required
					cancellation notice of a booking to the Instructor, You must still pay
					for the Instructor’s time and/or the use of his/her or Our vehicle. In
					that case, the Instructor will advise You on claiming compensation
					from the DVSA for the cost of those fees; and 9.9 If You have a test
					booked and in the Instructor’s opinion, You ,do not make the expected
					progress in Your lessons between the date of booking and the test
					date, the Instructor may decide not to permit You to use his/her or
					Our vehicle for Your test and We will not be responsible for any fees
					that You pay for the test which are lost.
				</p>

					may, at any time, subject to Your meeting the requirements of Clause 3
					as to giving notice of Your cancellation of lessons, terminate Your
					tuition by the School; and 10.3 Where sub-clause 10.1 or 10.2 applies,
					We shall refund to You any fees for lessons that You have paid in
					advance.
				</p>
				<h1>11. Liability</h1>
				<p>
					11.1 We will be responsible for any foreseeable loss or damage that
					You may suffer as a result of breach of these Terms and Conditions by
					Us or the Instructor or as a result of Our or his/her negligence. Loss
					or damage is foreseeable if it is an obvious consequence of Our or
					his/her breach or negligence or if it is contemplated by You and Us or
					him/her when Our contract with You is created. We will not be
					responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable; 11.2 We
					provide tuition only for Your personal and private use/purposes. We
					will not be liable to You for any loss of profit, loss of business,
					interruption to business or for any loss of business opportunity; 11.3

					or limit Our or the Instructor’s liability for death or personal
					injury caused by Our or the Instructor’s negligence or for fraud or
					fraudulent misrepresentation; 11.4 Furthermore, if you are a
					“consumer” as defined by the Consumer Rights Act 2015, or a consumer

					prejudice, or otherwise affect any of Our duties or obligations to
					You, or Your rights or remedies, or Our liability to You, under:
					11.4.1 the Consumer Rights Act 2015; 11.4.2 the Regulations; 11.4.3
					the Consumer Protection Act 1987; or 11.4.4 any other consumer

					time. For more details of Your legal rights, please refer to Your
					local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or Trading Standards Office. 11.5Subject
					to these Term and Conditions (and in particular without affecting
					Clause 2.1), we confirm that the School will not be responsible or
					liable for any: 11.5.1 negligent or other act or omission of the
					Instructor for which, if the Instructor were an employee of the
					School, the School would be responsible or liable; or 11.5.2 act or
					omission of the Instructor which, if it were Our act or omission,
					would be a breach by Us of Our contract with You; In any such case,
					Our responsibility or liability shall be no less or greater or
					different from what it would have been had the act or omission been
					that of the School or its employees acting in the course of their
					employment.
				</p>
				<h1>12. Changes to Terms and Conditions</h1>
				<p>
					We may, from time to time, change these Terms and Conditions without

					We will only use Your personal information as set out in Our Privacy
					Notice.
				</p>
				<h1>14. Regulations</h1>
				<p>
					We are required by the Regulations to ensure that certain information
					is given or made available to You as a Consumer before We make Our
					contract with You (i.e. before We or the Instructor accept Your
					request to book any lesson) except where that information is already
					apparent from the context of the transaction. We have included the
					information itself either in these Terms and Conditions for You to see
					now, or We will make it available to You or ensure that the Instructor
					does so before We or he/she accepts Your request to book a lesson. All
					of that information will, as required by the Regulations, be part of
					the terms of Our contract with You as a Consumer.
				</p>
				<h1>15. Information</h1>
				<p>
					15.1All of the information described in Clause 14; and 15.2 Any other
					information which We give to You about tuition or other services or
					the School which You take into account when deciding to book a lesson
					or when making any other decision about Our tuition or other services;
					will be part of the terms of Our contract with You as a Consumer.
				</p>
				<h1>16. Complaints</h1>
				<p>
					We always welcome feedback from Our Pupils and, whilst We always use
					all reasonable endeavours to ensure that We and Our Instructors
					provide a high standard of tuition and service to Pupils, We
					nevertheless want to hear from You if You have any cause for
